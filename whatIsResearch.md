On a grad panel where we were asked something to the effect of what would you focus on to get ready for graduate school?

We all agreed "do research" but what do we mean by that?

broadly: 
build a new tool to solve a new problem
use an old tool to solve a new problem
build a new tool to solve an old problem 
use an old tool to solve an old problem

improve someone else's work

identify a problem in a pre-existing approach

start on "future work" of someone else

write about it (dissertation means you need to write something)

talk about it (defense, oral qualifying exam, job talk)

think you understand, get confused, clear up why you are confused, repeat

often an iterative process, with lots of start over's

What skills are we building by doing research?

sense of SERVICE (could rant about this on another post, someone helped you, help someone else)

time management/handling unstructured time

goal setting

tracking and evaluating progress (document everything so you know what you have already tried/done)

making connections: this is like this, except for this

independence

read the literature (could be its own post)

``Undergraduate research experiences: Impacts and opportunities" by Marcia C. Linn, Erin Palmer, Anne Baranger, Elizabeth Gerard, and Elisa Stone in Science 2015


- ``develop a scientific identity"

important for statement of purpose and interviews, need to have a direction, see your place in the field

- ``resilience to failure"

grad school is hard (could be a a million posts)

like really hard



- "learned science practices (lab techniques, analyze data, oral and written communication)"



Follow up question: how important is originality and creativity in research? Can you really be doing research without coming up with your own idea of what to pursue?

seems standard to have your first research project suggested by a faculty member, or at least a reading suggestion or general topic to dig into

bad to have a hammer and to just seek out nails (or treat everything as a nail)
